LibAC NBT
====

This was heavily inspired by the NBT File format used by minecraft for the ability to save things reliably at a compact size.

Disclaimer
====

The code used here is of my own creation, as i tried to model it after the NBT format in use in minecraft, due to me wanting a format that i was familiar with using the API of while writing mods.

However, i made the decision to make it not binary compatible with Minecraft. I am sure with some tweaks it would be, but my decision is final as this format will be expanded upon in the future to deviate from the standard minecraft NBT.


Planned Changes
=========

I plan to add more data types, including a actual List implementation.

Another change that is planned, is optimizing this a little bit more, and adding other tag types.
