XMLRPC
======
-----------



This was ported from Nwc.XMLRPC (C#)

The following attributes found in the Assembly for NWC XMLRPC apply as most of this code is heavily derived from it.

However, as this is Java, only a small disclaimer is provided, as this is a near full rewrite to port the code to Java.

```cs
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.10.0.4")]
[assembly: AssemblyCompany("Ronin Consulting Inc, OpenSimulator")]
[assembly: AssemblyDescription("XML RPC client and server")]
[assembly: AssemblyTitle("XMLRPC")]
